        In Brief:
    </p>
    <p>
        Human activities (primarily the burning of fossil fuels) have fundamentally increased the concentration of greenhouse
        gases in Earth’s atmosphere, warming the planet. Natural drivers, without human intervention, would push our planet
        toward a cooling period.

    Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the
    "greenhouse effect"1 — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.
    
    Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the
    atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate
    change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as
    "feedbacks."
    
    Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:

<div class="content">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Water vapor. The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water
            vapor
            increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these
            some of
            the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Carbon dioxide (CO2). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural
                processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use
                changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 48% since the Industrial
                Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.
            </p>   
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Methane. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of
                wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management
                associated with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than
                carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.
            </p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Nitrous oxide. A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and
                organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.
            </p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now
                largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute
                to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.
